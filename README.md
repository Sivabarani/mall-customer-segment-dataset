# mall-customer-segment-dataset
This dataset contains details about 200 people who visted mall and their income, spending score.

**Understanding Supervised Learning** Supervised learning involves predicting an outcome based on labeled data. Initially, I considered this dataset for supervised learning (Classification) applications, it helps to find people who spend most.

**Dataset Description**
1. CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer (integer).
2. Genre: The gender of the customer (Male/Female).
3. Age: The age of the customer (integer).
4. Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars (integer).
5. Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending patterns (integer).

**Objective** The goal of this analysis is to find the people who spend mose. While the "Spending Score(1-100)" column is our main focus, we may also explore how other features relate to it, noting that they can be considered independent variables in this context.

**Understanding Data Relationships** Dependent vs. Independent Variables: Dependent Variable: In this case, the "Spending Score(1-100)" column, which we aim to analyze or predict. Independent Variables: Other features such as CusotmerID, Genre,Age, Annual Income (k$)
